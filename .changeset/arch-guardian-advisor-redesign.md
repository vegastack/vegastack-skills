arch-guardian v2: advisory-only redesign (breaking content change under 0.x)

- **Profile schema v4** (foundation 0.4.0): slim ~12-line profile — name, kind, **tier** (`prototype`/`production`/`enterprise`), tenancy, hosting, enabled capability list, notes. Versions come from lockfiles; exceptions removed. `profile-tool.mjs migrate` converts v3 profiles (exceptions become notes).
- **Checker removed**: `architecture-check.mjs`, `control-catalog.json`, and the PASS/FAIL/EXCEPTED outcome and exception machinery are deleted. Reviews now follow the evidence-backed advisory report contract (`references/advisory-report.md`) with severities `critical`/`production-gate`/`enterprise-gate`/`consider`, per-area grades, and a stable JSON block for downstream automation.
- **Tiers gate concerns, never tools**: rules carry tier floors; tool choices (OpenBao, pg-boss, EVE, Valkey) become defaults with named escalation triggers under the new minimum-viable-architecture principle. Rule `FOUND-002` retired (never reused).
- **Freshness upgrades**: OSV.dev advisory watch for every pinned package (fail-closed on critical sources), `reviewBy` overdue warnings for foundation baselines, verified `llms.txt` URLs in the source registry, and proportionate freshness (full check only for design reviews leaning on critical pins).
- CLI `doctor` validates v4 profiles and runs profile validation instead of the deleted checker.
