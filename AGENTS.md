# vegastack-skills — agent guide

<!-- vsk-dev:start -->
## Dev workflow

Read `.vegastack/dev.md` for the project's stack, commands, and knobs. The stages are the dev-family skills: dev-setup (bootstrap) · dev-intake (ideas to briefs) · dev-plan (approved briefs to plans) · dev-architect (stack judgment) · dev-implement (dark builds) · dev-debug (reproduce-first fixes) · dev-review (independent review) · dev-ship (gated landing) · dev-status (the operator's board) · dev-chronicle (the project's story).

Work flows through GitHub issues, labeled per dev.md's `labels:` knob; artifact formats follow dev-setup's `references/conventions.md`. Route each request by kind:

| Request | Skill |
|---|---|
| a new capability, feature, bug report, or SOW — in chat or as an unlabeled issue | dev-intake, which writes the issue and never builds |
| a `needs-plan` issue | dev-plan |
| a `ready` issue, a resume handover, or corrections on `for-operator` | dev-implement |
| a trivial fix asked in chat — one or two files, no new dependency, no behaviour beyond the words | dev-implement's direct path |
| "make the PR", "merge", "release" | dev-ship |
| "status", "catch me up" | dev-status, dev-chronicle |

**Local, reversible actions proceed; actions that are hard to reverse, affect shared systems, or are visible to others wait for the operator's word** — push to the default branch, merge, tag, publish, deploy, force-push, a hard reset, branch or worktree deletion, `--no-verify`. The `gates:` knob in dev.md changes how many of those one instruction covers, never whether an instruction is needed. Behavior changes carry their changelog entry (dev.md's `changelog:` knob) before hand-back; after merge, dev.md's `## Ship` runbook says which steps need the operator's word.

Agent conduct: say what you mean — when a literal phrase is available, use it. Lead with the outcome and spell out identifiers, because the reader did not watch the work. Report progress only against a tool result from this session, and say plainly when something is unverified. Pause for the operator only for a destructive or irreversible action, a real scope change, or input only they can provide — then ask and end the turn rather than end on a promise. The approved brief or plan is the scope; extras go in a note at the end. Edit files surgically, because a whole-file rewrite costs tokens for the same result.

Directional decisions (`## Decisions` in dev.md says what qualifies) get one dated line in the register dev.md names: when a session settles such a choice, propose the line and add it only on the user's yes.

dev.md is the project's self-maintained handbook: when a gotcha or repeated instruction surfaces, propose the one line that would have prevented it — folded into existing lines, never a log — and add it on the user's yes.

## Repo specifics

This repo *is* the dev-skills it ships, and it runs on them: `.vegastack/` is a live instance of the workflow described above, so the process docs here are also a worked example of the product.

- **Process authority:** CONTRIBUTING.md → `.vegastack/dev.md` → `skill-maintainer`'s release-ops.md → skill defaults. dev.md's `authority:` line is the one home for that order, and its `## Ship` runbook is the release flow.
- **`skills/` is the only source of truth.** `packages/cli/skill/` and `packages/cli/skill-integrity.json` are build output — written by `bun run build`, gitignored, never edited and never committed. A repo-wide search hits both trees and returns the same content twice; the copy under `packages/cli/skill/` is the stale one.
- **Layout is exactly two levels:** `skills/<group>/<name>/`, never deeper, with a `GROUP.md` per group — currently `dev-skills` and `repo-tooling`. The published bundle is flat, so skill names are unique across the whole tree and install commands never carry a group.
- **Authoring and standards:** new or changed skills go through `skillify`, which scaffolds the tree and performs the repo wiring itself; repo, release and scan-triage standards live in `skill-maintainer`. Both are listed in `packages/cli/repo-only.json`, so `add --all` skips them.
- **Verification is two commands, not one.** `bun run check` is the local gate. The SkillSpector scan is deliberately outside it — the scan needs Python 3.12 and the `skillspector` CLI while `check` stays Bun and Node only — and it reads the **built** bundle, so `bun run build` comes first; the authored tree's unpackaged test fixtures are adversarial on purpose and would score higher than anything that ships. Install line in CONTRIBUTING.md, invocation in dev.md's `## Verify`.
- **Agent-tool directories:** `.claude/` is gitignored, so installing skills there pollutes nothing. `.agents/` is **not** ignored — add the ignore line before installing into it.
