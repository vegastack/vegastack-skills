## Dev setup

Requirements: [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.14 (pinned in `packageManager`) and Node >= 24.

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check      # validate:skill + test + lint + typecheck
bun run build      # builds the CLI and syncs the skill copy into packages/cli
```

`bun run check` must pass before every PR. CI runs it on Node 24 plus a packed-tarball install smoke test.

### Scanning the skills

Every skill this repo ships is scanned by [NVIDIA SkillSpector](https://github.com/NVIDIA/skillspector) before a push, and again before a release. It is **not** part of `bun run check` — `check` must keep running on Bun and Node alone, while SkillSpector needs Python 3.12 and ~70 packages — so install it once:

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/skillspector.git
bun run build && node skills/dev-skills/dev-review/scripts/skill-scan.mjs --json
```

Run it from the repo root: with no `--root` it reads the `skill-scan:` knob from `.vegastack/dev.md` and applies `.vegastack/skillspector-baseline.json` by convention. A profile it cannot read is an error, not a skip — the guard refuses rather than quietly passing from the wrong directory.

The guard refuses (exit 2) when the binary is missing rather than passing quietly. It blocks on any unsuppressed **HIGH or CRITICAL** finding, never on the aggregate risk score — a skills repo documents the mechanics the scanner matches on, so the score says more about our subject matter than our risk. Build first: the knob names `packages/cli/skill/`, because the authored tree's unpackaged `tests/` fixtures are deliberately adversarial.

Suppressions live in `.vegastack/skillspector-baseline.json`. Adding one is a security decision needing the maintainer's word, scoped as narrowly as its cause, with a `reason` carrying a **"Still flag if:"** clause the guard enforces. Widening a rule to make the guard green is the failure mode, not the fix.

## Repo layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `skills/` | Authored skill content — the single source of truth. Edit here. A skill sits at `skills/<name>/` or, inside a group, at `skills/<group>/<name>/` — one level, never deeper. |
| `skills/dev-skills/` | The dev-workflow group (setup, intake, plan, architect, implement, debug, review, ship, status, chronicle): a `GROUP.md` plus ten skills, each with `SKILL.md`, references, deterministic scripts where they earn them, tests. |
| `<skill>/refresh/` | Freshness contract: source registry and refresh instructions consumed by the weekly refresh automation. |
| `packages/cli/` | The `@vegastack/skills` installer. `packages/cli/skill/` and `skill-integrity.json` are **generated at build** from `skills/` — never edit or commit them. |
| `packages/cli/repo-only.json` | The skills `add --all` skips because they only make sense inside this repository. Hand-maintained; validated by the build. |
| `.vegastack/` | The project's own dev workflow instance: `dev.md` (the canonical process doc — release runbook, versioning, rollback), `decisions.md` (the decision register), and `skillspector-baseline.json` (audited skill-scan suppressions). |

## Never commit generated files

`dist/`, `packages/cli/skill/`, `packages/cli/skill-integrity.json`, `work/`, and `.vegastack/evidence-*.json` are build or tooling outputs. They are gitignored; `prepack` regenerates what the package needs. PRs that add them will be rejected.

## Adding a new skill

Every skill lives at `skills/<name>/` or `skills/<group>/<name>/` and is self-contained:

| File/dir | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | yes | Agent entry point — valid frontmatter (`name`, `description`), progressive routing to references |
| `README.md` | yes | Human/agent walkthrough of the whole skill (repo-side only; not packaged) |
| `references/` | if applicable | Normative content, loaded on demand (a self-contained skill may have none) |
| `scripts/` | if applicable | Deterministic, dependency-free Node scripts |
| `assets/` | if applicable | Templates, schemas, examples |
| `tests/` | yes | Bun tests and the trigger-query fixture (never packaged); unit tests are required for scripts' deterministic branches, not for prose |
| `refresh/sources.json` + `refresh/REFRESH.md` | yes | Freshness contract for the weekly refresh automation, or a one-line evergreen waiver |
| `agents/openai.yaml` | for Codex | Codex interface metadata |

The skillify scaffolder creates this tree and performs the repo wiring itself: the per-skill packaging allowlist entry in `packages/cli/packaging.json` (the build fails loudly on authored files that are neither allowlisted nor deliberately unpackaged), the root README skills-table row, and the changeset. Files added to a skill after scaffolding must be appended to its `packaging.json` entry by hand.

One wiring file the scaffolder does **not** write: `packages/cli/repo-only.json` lists the skills that operate on this repository itself, so `add --all` skips them. Add a skill there by hand if it is useless in a consumer project; the build fails if the list names a skill that does not exist.

## Adding or modifying content

Skill content is advisory prose and decision tables, not a rule corpus — there are no rule IDs
and no machine-extracted rule format to follow.

- New reference files or reference sections, and new/changed recorded decisions (e.g. a new
  "use/not/why" row, a new red line) are MINOR content changes — see the content-semver bullet
  in [.vegastack/dev.md](.vegastack/dev.md) (detail in
  [skill-maintainer's release-ops](skills/repo-tooling/skill-maintainer/references/release-ops.md)).
- Factual refreshes and non-normative wording clarifications are PATCH.
- Removing a skill, or a breaking change to the per-project profile format, is MAJOR;
  renaming a skill ships MINOR by default — major only when the operator declares it.
- Keep volatile facts (version pins, vendor mechanism names) in `pinned-facts.md`-style dated
  entries so the refresh system can track them.

## Refresh PRs

Branches named `refresh/**` are reserved for the automated freshness loop and are CI-restricted to refresh metadata at either legal depth. Human content changes go on normal branches.

## Releases

Versioning and publishing are maintainer-driven via changesets and tag-triggered CI — the `## Ship` runbook in [.vegastack/dev.md](.vegastack/dev.md) is the release flow, rollback included. Contributors do not bump versions in PRs. Changeset entries follow the shape in the dev-implement skill's changelog rule ([skills/dev-skills/dev-implement/SKILL.md](skills/dev-skills/dev-implement/SKILL.md)) — the published changelog and the release notes reproduce them verbatim.
