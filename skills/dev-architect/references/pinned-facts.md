# Pinned platform facts

Dated, source-verified facts that change architecture decisions and that models routinely
get wrong from stale training data. This file is the verified cache behind SKILL.md's
verify-before-you-recommend protocol, and the ONLY file in this skill that goes stale by
itself — the weekly refresh (see refresh/REFRESH.md) re-verifies it. When a recommendation
leans on a fact older than 60 days, re-verify that one fact against its source first.

Facts carry their own verification dates (sections verified 2026-08-12 unless a bullet says otherwise; Better Auth and EVE re-verified 2026-08-29).

## Cloudflare

- **R2 egress is $0 at any volume.** A 500GB-stored / 2TB-served workload is ~$191/mo on
  S3 vs ~$7.50/mo on R2. Reaching for S3+CloudFront "to control egress" solves a problem R2
  doesn't have. Lifecycle rules, bucket locks, event notifications, and Infrequent Access
  are all live — note IA transitions are one-way via lifecycle (IA→Standard needs a manual
  CopyObject). [developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing]
- **Hyperdrive supports PostgreSQL 9.0–17.x — PG 18 is NOT supported.** Target Postgres 17
  for any Hyperdrive-fronted database; re-check the supported-versions page before ever
  moving to 18. Hyperdrive also supports MySQL (GA 2026-08-07) and private DBs via Workers
  VPC. [developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/reference/supported-databases-and-features]
- **Durable Objects default to SQLite storage** (real SQL, transactions, point-in-time
  recovery), and **hibernating WebSocket DOs bill ~$0 while idle** — one-DO-per-room is
  cost-competitive with Redis+socket.io for mostly-idle connections.
  [developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects]
- **Workflows: 10,000 steps default / 25,000 max, 365-day sleeps — and per-step billing
  since 2026-08-10.** High-step-count designs now have a real cost dimension.
  [developers.cloudflare.com/workflows]
- **Browser Rendering is metered by duration AND concurrency** ($0.09/browser-hour + $2 per
  extra concurrent browser) — batch scraping through a queue; it is not free headless Chrome.
  [developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering]
- **R2/KV/Workflows event notifications route through Queues "event subscriptions"** — a
  Queue consumer covers platform state changes; don't build a bespoke webhook receiver.
- **D1 read replication only helps via the Sessions API** (`withSession(bookmark)`);
  without it every query still hits the primary.

## Next.js (16.3, released 2026-08-03)

- **PPR flags are gone** — `experimental.ppr` no longer exists; partial prerendering is
  part of `cacheComponents: true` (which also replaced `dynamicIO`). [nextjs.org/blog]
- **`middleware.ts` is replaced by `proxy.ts` running on Node** — full fs/crypto/native
  package access in request interception.
- **`proxy.ts`/Node middleware does NOT work on OpenNext Cloudflare as of 2026-08** (open
  issues opennextjs-cloudflare#962/#1277, workers-sdk#13755/#13937) — don't design a
  Cloudflare-hosted feature around `proxy.ts`; re-check the trackers before assuming it
  shipped. Turbopack is supported since adapter v1.15.0 (the old breakage is fixed;
  re-verify only on older pins).
- **The Adapter API is stable since 16.2** — Vercel's adapter and Cloudflare's OpenNext
  adapter share the same public contract, but Cloudflare's still trails on newest features;
  check the deployment feature matrix per feature, don't assume parity.
  [nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/deploying-to-platforms]

## Cloudflare Workers hard limits

- **Memory 128MB per isolate (hard), CPU 30s default / 5min max (configurable), 1000
  subrequests per request (paid).** Heavy transforms (image processing, big parses)
  belong in a container/worker tier, not a Worker. Workers Logs free tier: 200k
  events/day, 3-day retention; automatic tracing starts billing 2026-10-01; OTLP export
  needs Workers Paid. [developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits]

## Better Auth (1.7.2, 2026-08-29)

- **1.7 is stable** — 1.7.0 shipped 2026-08-18, current 1.7.2 (2026-08-26, npm latest).
  The former 1.6.x hold is retired; adopt 1.7.x via the official migration steps. Notable
  1.7.0 breaks beyond the bullets below: accounts rekeyed on `(issuer, accountId)` with a
  migration backfill; `validAudiences` → `resources` + `oauthClientResource`;
  `experimental.joins` → `advanced.database.joins`; generic OAuth rewritten on OAuth 2.1
  defaults. [github.com/better-auth releases, verified 2026-08-29]
- **The MCP plugin lives in `@better-auth/mcp` since 1.7.0** — requires
  `@better-auth/cimd` and the `jwt()` plugin; `withMcpAuth` → `requireMcpAuth`,
  `mcpHandler` → `createMcpProtectedRequestHandler`; options are flat, no `oidcConfig`
  nesting. [releases/tag/v1.7.0]
- **SAML IdP-initiated sign-in is default-off since 1.7.0** (`saml.allowIdpInitiated`
  defaults to false); opt back in explicitly only where the IdP flow is required.
  [releases/tag/v1.7.0, verified 2026-08-29]
- **The organizations plugin models teams, invitations, and custom RBAC end-to-end**
  (`teams: { enabled: true }`, `inviteMember` with `teamId`, `createAccessControl`) —
  unchanged in 1.7 (SCIM was decoupled from it; irrelevant unless SCIM is used).
  [better-auth.com/docs, verified 2026-08-29]
- **The apiKey plugin is the standalone `@better-auth/api-key` package** (lockstep
  1.7.2) — import from `@better-auth/api-key`, not `better-auth/plugins` (core's exports
  no longer carry it). Default to the plugin for new projects; the flagship platform's
  native implementation is a recorded project decision, not the house default. The
  `bearer` plugin stays in core and covers token session transport (the mobile/Flutter
  mechanism). [better-auth.com/docs/plugins/api-key, verified 2026-08-29]
- **`twoFactor` supports `allowPasswordless: true`** for users without password accounts
  (passkey/OAuth/magic-link signups). Since 1.7.0, `enableTwoFactor` takes and returns a
  discriminated `method: "otp" | "totp"` (default totp) — pass `method: "otp"` for OTP
  enrollment.

## Agents & jobs

- **EVE (`eve` on npm, github.com/vercel/eve) is Vercel's durable-agent framework — v0.47.3
  (2026-08-28), still beta/pre-GA, shipping multiple releases per day; pin behavior, not
  minor versions.** Filesystem-first agents; every
  session a durable, resumable workflow. [vercel.com/docs/eve]
- **Self-hosted EVE durability (`@workflow/world-postgres`, stable 4.3.x) explicitly
  requires a long-lived worker process — "not compatible with serverless platforms".**
  The 5.0.0-beta channel exists; don't pin it without a documented reason. Internally it
  uses graphile-worker — it is not pg-boss and doesn't replace it.
  [workflow-sdk.dev/worlds/postgres]
- **pg-boss is at 12.x** — Postgres-native (`SKIP LOCKED`), no Redis. The right default
  for simple background jobs/cron on this stack; BullMQ only when a genuinely complex job
  graph (flows, dependencies, rate-limited pipelines) demands Redis. [npm: pg-boss]
- **trigger.dev v4 is Apache-2.0 and self-hostable free with unlimited runs** — the
  credible escape hatch when a job needs multi-hour runtimes off-platform. [trigger.dev]

## Databases & mobile

- **PlanetScale Postgres is built on Neki, not Vitess** — a newer product (GA 2025-09);
  don't transfer Vitess/MySQL assumptions. No free tier (the free Hobby plan died April
  2024); Postgres pricing is SKU-based from PS-5 non-HA at $5/mo, HA from ~$15-50/mo.
  ($39/mo figures seen elsewhere are the Vitess/MySQL PS-10 tier — a different product.)
  [planetscale.com/pricing]
- **Flutter's default renderer is Impeller on iOS, Android, and macOS** — "disable
  Impeller on Android" guidance is stale. [docs.flutter.dev]

## Self-hosting

- **Coolify needs ~2GB RAM for its own control plane and requires active patching** —
  two critical-CVE waves in 2026 alone (Jan: beta.445/451; Jun-Jul: CVE-2026-34047/49/50,
  fixed in beta.471) — a recurring pattern, not a closed incident. Size Hetzner VMs
  accordingly (CX22/4GB is the floor for Coolify + one small app); ~30 min/month real
  maintenance, not zero. [coolify.io]
