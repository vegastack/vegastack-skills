description: Implement an approved GitHub issue end to end without further user input. Use when given an issue to build — "do issue 12", "implement" plus an issue URL or number, "pick up the next ready issue", "go dark on" an issue — when resuming a dead or compacted session's working issue the operator hands over, when returning to apply corrections the user left on a for-operator issue, or for a trivial fix asked directly in chat — one or two files, no new dependency. Not for a new feature or capability asked in chat, or writing or approving issues (dev-intake), planning them (dev-plan), reviewing finished work (dev-review), or creating PRs and merging (dev-ship).

# dev-implement

Act: build the approved issue end to end, dark, and hand the evidence back in the issue.

One issue, one session: preflight → claim → build dark → verify → review → evidence → stop. The operator reads the result in the issue; PRs and merges are `dev-ship`'s, on the operator's word. The ledger discipline lives in [ledger-and-resume](references/ledger-and-resume.md).

Nearest neighbors: `dev-plan` writes the plan this skill executes task by task; `dev-review` judges the result; an issue that turns out to need a decision goes back through `needs-operator` and is asked there, because a guessed decision is one the operator did not make. dev.md's knobs govern this skill; its `## Architecture` section governs stack-touching choices.

## Direct requests — trivial only, tightly bounded

When the operator asks in chat for a change, their words are the approval — build, verify, report; no issue needed. The bound is trivial: a behavior change beyond the asked words, a new dependency, or more than 1–2 files routes to `dev-intake` instead. Branch `<type>/<slug>`, in its own worktree like everything else ([worktrees](references/worktrees.md)); the changelog and chronicle rules apply when behavior changes; shipping still goes through dev-ship's words.

## Preflight — all must hold, or stop and say which failed

- Run the guard first: `node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/preflight.mjs --issue <n> --me $(gh api user -q .login) --json` (add `--repo <o/r> --dev-md <path>` outside the project root). Exit 2 stops you with its reasons; exit 1 passes with warnings, which go into the ledger. Resume and corrections runs pass `--expect working` / `--expect for-operator`.
- Then the judgment checks: read the complete brief plus parent issue and milestone; read the brief's touch points in the current code, because they drift between approval and execution — the version-impact line, volatile dependency claims per `dev-architect`'s verify protocol, and a full-plan issue's plan included. A material decision left open — even outside a formal Assumptions section — or reality contradicting brief or plan is a stop: one `handback` comment with the smallest question, `needs-operator`.
- Resuming a dead session's issue takes the operator's explicit handover, then the resume protocol in [ledger-and-resume](references/ledger-and-resume.md): brief → plan → ledger → `git log`, nothing else — in the branch's worktree, restored with `worktree.mjs restore --issue <n> --slug <slug> --write` when its directory is gone. A claim being abandoned instead is released by the operator with `node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/reclaim.mjs --issue <n>` (`working` → `ready`, unassign; refuses a still-fresh ledger unless `--force`) — a claim is released on their word only.

## Claim

One session owns one issue — one claim at a time, because dev-status reads each ledger as one session's heartbeat. Assign yourself and remove any other assignee, swap `ready` → `working`, and cut the branch and its worktree with `node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/worktree.mjs create --issue <n> --slug <slug> --type <type> --write --json` (epic child: add `--parent <parent-branch>`; the full matrix is [worktrees](references/worktrees.md)). Then create the ledger comment as your first write, recording the worktree path, because its edit time is the claim's only liveness signal and a claim whose session dies before writing it is invisible. Record each task's base sha before starting it. Every label flip this skill makes carries the assignee conventions' Labels table names — a hand-back to `for-operator` assigns the issue's operator and drops the runner, so the operator's notification is GitHub's own and needs no extra tooling.

## Build — dark, test-first, checkpointed

No questions. Every ledger checkpoint line is also the chat update — one text, two destinations — and in a headless run the issue is the only channel. A `fix:` issue's diagnosis runs under `dev-debug`, whose phases govern the investigation and whose winning suspect feeds the evidence comment. A spike the brief flagged runs first; its result opens the evidence comment. Then work the plan task by task:

- **Red before green**, because a test written after the code proves only that the code runs. Write the failing test first — at the seams the brief names, and only there, because a seam the brief did not name is one review cannot judge — watch it fail for the stated reason, implement the minimal code, watch it pass. One slice at a time. The tests-are-real rubric (implementation-coupled, tautological, horizontal-sliced — defined in `dev-review`'s dispatch prompts) applies to your own tests before a reviewer sees them.
- **Checkpoint the ledger** after every task and tick the matching `[x]` in the plan comment in the same pass — the reference says why both writes matter.
- The scope ratchet is a stop condition: work revealed bigger than the issue's scope class (or plainly exceeding one session) → one `handback` comment proposing the upgrade or split (dev-plan's ratchet rules), `needs-operator`, stop.

The approved brief and plan are the scope. Extras you notice go in the evidence comment's Not done / limits line as a follow-up note, not in the diff; an assumption you had to make is stated in the summary. Tests are sized like their neighbours — one focused test per behaviour the brief states, at the seams it names. When the code can just change, change it: no feature flag, compat shim or parallel path for a caller that does not exist, because each is a moving part nobody asked for. Decide routine things yourself and ledger the rulings; a structural choice — a new dependency, table or service — checks `dev-architect`'s trigger discipline first, and a moving part with no named trigger is a stop condition. Hitting any stop condition — the brief's out-of-scope section, dev.md's stop-list, the scope ratchet — ends dark mode with one `handback` comment stating the smallest decision needed, your recommendation attached — and where that decision has options, the handback comment carries the round rendered by `scripts/questions.mjs`, so the operator's reply parses like any other (`references/ask-route.md`).

**Honesty over green**: a failing test gets fixed at the root or reported as failing, because weakening a test, an assertion, or acceptance to pass is a cover-up, and cover-ups surface at review with interest.

## Changelog and chronicle — before hand-back

Every behavior-changing branch carries its changelog entry per dev.md's `changelog:` knob and, when dev.md says `chronicle: on`, its story entry — both on the branch, landing atomically with the merge; the per-knob mechanics and the entry's first-line rule live in [changelog-and-chronicle](references/changelog-and-chronicle.md). Docs the brief names as affected get updated in the same branch.

## Verify — the gate function

Before claiming any status, run the proving command fresh and read its exit code (conventions' verification gate); a subagent's diff or report file is evidence, its say-so is not.

- Run what dev.md's `tests:` knob requires; a `risky` issue gets focused security, failure, and recovery checks on top; a `## Verify` runbook means run the app and smoke-check the flows it names. Post-release checks live in `## Ship` and belong to dev-ship.
- Run the skill-scan guard, unconditionally: `node <path-to-dev-review>/scripts/skill-scan.mjs --json` — it reads dev.md's `skill-scan:` knob itself and exits 0 when the project authors no skills. Exit 2 blocks the hand-back: fix the finding, or take it to the operator for a justified baseline rule — a suppression needs the operator's word, because a widened rule hides the next finding too. Findings below the blocking bar are the security axis's to triage at review.
- UI changed and `ui-evidence: playwright` → capture screenshots of the key states and upload each with `node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/evidence-upload.mjs --repo <o/r> --issue <n> --file <png> --write --json` — it reads dev.md's `evidence-repo:` knob and names the file `<this-repo-name>/<issue-number>/<timestamp>-<name>.png` (dry-run without `--write`; exit 2 says what it refused). Link them in the evidence comment as links, because private-repo images don't render inline. Evidence repo unreachable → name local paths and say so, and the hand-back proceeds, because evidence is a link, not a gate.
- dev.md's Ship or Verify section is an empty TODO next to visible machinery → finish normally, then suggest re-running dev-setup.

## Independent review — invoke dev-review

Run `dev-review` per dev.md's `review:` knob — fresh subagent axes by default, cross-agent (Codex↔Claude, announced to the operator) per the knob's mapping; it owns the axes, severities, review comment, bounded fix loop, and adjudication rules. Apply its findings through its loop and re-run the affected checks. Disagree with a finding → adjudicate openly per its rules, because a skipped finding is a decision made in secret. Every target harness spawns the axes (Claude Code subagents, Codex agents, Hermes `delegate_task`); only a headless run that cannot spawn runs the axis briefs itself, labeled as a self-review, because independence is the one thing it lacks.

## The evidence comment — exactly one, edited in place

```markdown
<!-- vsk:v1 type=evidence rev=1 branch=<name> sha=<sha7> -->
## Result (v1)
**Done:** what changed, in behavior terms
**Tests:** <command> → <fresh result>
**Review:** <mode> — <verdict; adjudications and rulings surfaced, in order made>
**Changelog:** <entry added / none, with reason>
**Docs:** brief v<n>, plan v<n> — in sync | unchanged since approval
**UI evidence:** <links>            (when applicable)
**Decision:** <register-format proposals>   (only choices passing dev.md's Decisions test)
**Not done / limits:** the honest list
Branch: <name> @ <sha7>
```

The tail's sha stays bare, because GitHub auto-links it once the branch is pushed while a hand-written `/commit/` link 404s until then. The `**Review:**` line is the one home of surfaced rulings: every ledger `Ruling:` appears there, in the order made. Run `node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/evidence-check.mjs --file <draft> --issue <n> --json` before posting — it checks the draft's shape and, with `--issue`, that the plan comment's `[x]` boxes reflect the ledger's completed tasks; exit 2 means fix, don't post. The evidence comment is the operator's whole read: one line per field, the Not done / limits list complete, and the closing recap repeats it in under 150 words. Post it, swap `working` → `for-operator` with the assignee moved to the operator, and stop; the recap repeats the evidence content rather than replacing it.

## Corrections loop — code and docs move together

The operator's comments on a `for-operator` issue are the new frontier. Corrections reuse the same worktree, restored if gone. Applying a correction is one pass: the code change + the affected brief/plan sections edited to match (revision markers bumped, `Revisions:` line appended) + a ledger line + the evidence comment updated in place — its `sha` to the new head and its `Docs:` line to the new revisions. Run the checks the correction touched. An operator dismissal of a review finding gets appended to `.vegastack/review-known-patterns.md` with its "Still flag if:" clause. Then back to `for-operator`. A correction that changes scope goes back through `needs-operator` and intake's recording rule; any other lands without re-approval.
