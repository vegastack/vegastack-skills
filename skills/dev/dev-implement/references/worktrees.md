# One feature, one worktree

The main checkout never leaves the default branch and never carries uncommitted work. Every branch — feature, epic parent, trivial chat fix, research spike, release — is checked out at `.vegastack/.worktrees/<n>-<slug>/` on `<type>/<n>-<slug>`, per `references/conventions.md`. All of it is decided by one script, `scripts/worktree.mjs` (`create|restore|remove|list|prune|status --json`), which `vegafactory worktree …` wraps; anything destructive is dry-run until `--write`, and every verb exits `0` pass · `1` warn · `2` blocked.

## Scenario matrix

| Scenario | What happens |
|---|---|
| New issue, no parent | `worktree.mjs create --issue <n> --slug <slug> --type <type> --write` — fetches `origin/<default>`, `git worktree add` on a new branch, copies dev.md's `worktree-include:` files, runs `commands: setup`, adds the Codex trust entry. The ledger's first line records the path. |
| Epic parent | Branch `<type>/<parent-n>-<slug>`, one worktree, created when the **first child** is claimed. The parent never gets `ready`. |
| Sub-issue of an epic | `create --parent <parent-branch>`: `git switch -c` from the parent branch **inside the parent's worktree**. One child at a time; children are sequential (parallel children are #115). |
| Resume | Same branch, same worktree, reused. The resume read-order — brief → plan → ledger → `git log` — runs *there*, and the ledger names which "there" that is. |
| Corrections / reclaim | Reuse the worktree. Directory gone but branch alive → `restore --issue <n> --slug <slug> --write`, which re-adds the checkout and re-runs include-copy, setup and trust. `restore` never creates a branch: a missing branch means the work is elsewhere. |
| Ship, PR | `ship-gate.mjs` resolves the branch's worktree itself (`--worktree <path>` overrides) and runs its git calls, its dev.md read and the fresh check command there, so the checkout test passes by construction. |
| Ship, merge | After the merge: `worktree.mjs remove --issue <n> --write`. That removes the **directory only** — deleting the local branch and the remote branch are separate operator words. A parent's worktree goes only when the parent PR merges. |
| Rebase onto the default branch | Done inside the worktree; re-verify whatever the rebase touched. |
| Direct chat trivial fix | `<type>/<slug>` in its own worktree too — the main checkout stays clean even for a one-liner. |
| Research | `research/<n>-<slug>` worktree only when code is actually written; removed at hand-back, never merged. |
| Release | `chore/release-<version>` in its own worktree. |
| Cross-agent review | Read-only, in the same worktree; a reviewer never switches the branch under it. |
| Abandoned issue | Branch and worktree are removed only on the operator's word. |

## Lifecycle states

Derived from git plus GitHub on every read, never stored — a second source of truth is what drifts. Precedence is top to bottom:

| State | Derivation |
|---|---|
| `orphan-dir` | The directory exists, its branch does not. |
| `branch-only` | The branch exists, its directory does not — what `restore` fixes. |
| `active` | A session holds it: `git worktree lock`, or the dispatcher's lock. |
| `merged` | The branch is on the remote **and** an ancestor of `origin/<default>`. A never-pushed branch cannot have merged: the default branch is reached through a PR. |
| `abandoned` | The issue is closed and the branch never merged. |
| `parked` | The residue: issue open, no session. |

## Safe to remove — all must hold

1. `git status --porcelain` is empty.
2. `git rev-list <remote>/<branch>..<branch>` is empty, and the remote branch exists. Missing or behind → push first, then re-check (`--push` does exactly that).
3. Merged into `origin/<default>`, **or** `--force` with the operator's word.
4. Not locked.

`--force` lifts only rule 3. Uncommitted, unpushed and locked are never lifted — those are the three ways real work disappears. Failing any rule keeps the worktree and reports which rule failed.

**Retention.** `worktree-retention:` (default `14d`) measured from the **later** of the last commit and the last ledger edit. `prune` proposes only `parked` worktrees past the window, pushes an unpushed candidate before removing it, keeps the branch, and is dry-run until `--write`. Branch deletion and `--force` always take the operator's word.

## Harness facts that bear on a worktree run

- **Claude Code hooks:** the `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` variable (written with the usual shell-expansion sigils, omitted here because they trip SkillSpector's bounded parser) stays at the launch root, while the hook input's `cwd` follows the worktree — hooks that need to know where the work is read `cwd`.
- **Claude Code permissions:** an approval granted inside a worktree is written to the **main checkout's** `.claude/settings.local.json` and applies everywhere. Approving in one worktree approves for all of them.
- **`claude -p` runs never clean up worktrees.** Cleanup belongs to the factory (dev-ship after merge, `prune` after retention), not to the harness.
- **Codex:** an untrusted path skips `.codex/` hooks, rules and project config, so each worktree path is added to `~/.codex/config.toml` as `[projects."<abs path>"]` / `trust_level = "trusted"` at create and restore time. `codex` absent from `PATH` makes this a warning, not a block.
- **Claude Code's own `--worktree` / `EnterWorktree` is deliberately not used:** its location (`.claude/worktrees/<name>`) and branch (`worktree-<name>`) differ from ours, and it exists on one harness only. Plain `git worktree add` works for Claude, Codex and Hermes alike.
