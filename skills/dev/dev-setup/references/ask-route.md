# The ask route

Where a round of questions goes when a skill needs the user. Two surfaces: the harness's question tool, or the issue itself. This file is the one home for the route, the comment shape and the reply grammar; `scripts/questions.mjs` is the deterministic method behind them, and the marker row lives in [conventions](conventions.md).

## The route

Three steps, in this order, first match wins:

1. `VSK_ASK_ROUTE` is set to `issue` or `tool` — the dispatcher and CI set it; any other non-empty value is refused rather than guessed.
2. This harness and this run have no question tool → `issue`.
3. The asker is not the issue's operator → `issue`. An unresolved asker or operator is also `issue`.

Otherwise the tool. Settle it deterministically rather than by judgement:

```sh
node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/questions.mjs route --tool <name|none> --asker <login> --operator <login> --json
```

Which tool each harness has — and the Codex Plan-mode gating on `request_user_input` — is recorded in [harness-facts](harness-facts.md) and not restated here. The operator identity comes from the caller under dev.md's `operators:` knob; the script takes both logins as inputs and never resolves them itself.

The bias is deliberate: a round in a comment is always readable by whoever owns the issue, and a round put to the wrong person is not.

## The comment

One comment per round, marker first, the whole round wrapped in `<questions>` tags so the parser and the model both find it inside a comment that may carry prose around it:

```markdown
<!-- vsk:v1 type=questions rev=1 -->
## Questions (v1)

<questions>
**Q1.** Where does the reminder queue live?
- a) A Postgres table
- b) A Redis list (recommended — Redis is already a dependency)

**Q2.** How late may a reminder fire?
- a) Within the hour (recommended — matches the existing cron cadence)
- b) Same day

Reply with `1: a` per question, or `all recommended`.
</questions>
```

Every question carries at least two options and exactly one recommendation, and every recommendation carries its one-line reason — a round that cannot say which way it leans is a round that has not been thought through, and the renderer refuses it. Options run `a` through `h`. After posting, the label moves to `needs-operator` and the session ends.

## Replying

Anyone on the issue may answer, in an ordinary comment, one line per question:

- `1: b`
- `2: a — the cron already runs` (trailing prose after the dash is kept)
- `3: other — a third way` (`other` is accepted for any question)
- `all recommended` on its own line fills every question not answered explicitly

An explicit line always beats `all recommended`. Bulleted lines, a `.` instead of `:`, and upper-case letters all parse. Surrounding prose is ignored; the first answer to a question stands and a repeat is reported.

## Re-asks

Parse before asking anything. A later session has no `round.json` on disk, so it reads the round back out of the posted comment — that is what the `<questions>` wrapper is for, and `--round <comment.md>` takes it in place of `--spec`. What comes back is answered questions, still-open questions, and malformed lines. If nothing is open, continue — never re-ask an answered question. If something is open, post a second comment at `rev=<n+1>` carrying only the open questions **at their original numbers**, so `**Q3.**` stays Q3. Earlier `questions` comments are left in place as record. A reply with no answer line at all is malformed, not empty: it gets one re-ask naming the expected shape.

## What it is not

An answer is not an approval. Any teammate may answer a round; only the operator approves, and approval is still its own `approval` marker comment recording the operator's own words in the `(<username>)` format ([conventions](conventions.md)). A round that is fully answered unblocks the work; it does not move the issue to `ready`.

Assignment is not this route's job either — the label moving to `needs-operator` is what puts the issue on the operator.

## Commands

Save the reply comment to `.vegastack/.tmp/<issue>-<slug>/reply.md` first; the parser reads a file, never a network.

```sh
node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/questions.mjs render --spec round.json --rev 1 --json
node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/questions.mjs parse  --comment reply.md --round asked.md --json
node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/questions.mjs re-ask --round asked.md --comment reply.md --rev 2 --json
node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/questions.mjs route  --tool none --asker <login> --operator <login> --json
```

`asked.md` is the posted `questions` comment; `--spec round.json` takes the same round as JSON instead, where the rendering session still has it. A spec is `{ "questions": [ { "text": "…", "options": [ { "letter": "a", "text": "…" }, { "letter": "b", "text": "…", "recommended": true, "reason": "…" } ] } ] }`.

Exit codes: 0 pass · 1 answers still open or malformed, and for `re-ask` nothing left to ask · 2 refusal or usage error.
